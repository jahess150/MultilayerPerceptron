## Project Overview

This repository contains a custom implementation of a multilayer perceptron neural network built from the ground up using Python. The project uses the MNIST handwritten digit dataset to train and evaluate the network. It aims to provide a thorough understanding of both the mathematical foundations and code implementations of neural networks.

**Disclaimer:** This code is largely not my own. I have adapted it slightly to my own style, but the majority of the code is from the YouTube video [Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH (no Tensorflow/Pytorch, just numpy & math)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&t=640s&ab_channel=SamsonZhang) by Samson Zhang. It's a fantastic resource for those wanting to learn more about neural networks, and was a huge help for me in developing this project. 

## Repository Contents

### 1. **MathBehindNeuralNetworks.pdf**
A LaTeX-generated PDF document detailing the mathematical foundation of the multilayer perceptron. This document covers topics such as:
- The structure of the neural network
- Explanations of forward propagation, backpropagation, and parameter updating
- Equations and diagrams to aid with understanding

This file serves as a theoretical reference for understanding how the neural network functions.

### 2. **MultilayerPerceptron.ipynb**
A Jupyter Notebook containing:
- Python code for the custom-built multilayer perceptron
- Detailed documentation of the code
- Step-by-step walkthrough of the training process on the MNIST dataset
- Visualizations and evaluations of the modelâ€™s performance

This notebook provides a hands-on implementation of the concepts outlined in the PDF.
